## 🚀 **Overview**

This project is a classic **Simon Game** where players have to repeat an increasing sequence of colors and sounds.  

It allows users to:  
- 🔴 Follow sequences of colored buttons  
- 🟢 Hear sounds corresponding to each color  
- 🎯 Challenge their memory as levels increase  
- 🏆 Keep track of the score  

This is a fun way to learn **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **timing functions**.
